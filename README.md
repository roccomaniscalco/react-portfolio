# React Portfolio

This online portfolio was designed as an archive for projects and a means to express myself as a developer. The site contains a landing page, an about, projects, and a contact section.

This is a refactor of [portfolio](https://github.com/roccomaniscalco/portfolioreact). The site has been optimized and built with [React](https://reactjs.org/). In order to be compliant with modern web best practices, the site is responsive and optimized for mobile viewports.
