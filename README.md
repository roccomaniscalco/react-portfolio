# React Portfolio

This online portfolio was designed as an archive for projects and a means to express myself as a developer. The site contains a landing page, an about, projects, and a contact section.

This is a refactor of the [portfolio project](https://github.com/roccomaniscalco/portfolioreact) with React. In order to be compliant with modern web best practices, the site is responsive and optimized for mobile viewports. In line with the focus of the project, I challenged myself to build this site without the use of a CSS framework.
